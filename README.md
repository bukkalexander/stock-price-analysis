# stock-price-analysis
The aim of this repo was to performe what is called "Backtesting", i.e. the method of evaluating a stock market trading strategy on historical stock data.

The idea was to scrap the web for stock data automatically, i.e. download information on stock data through an automated process, with a python library called Selenium. Then, when the data was downloaded, some data processing was to be performed, and then, some interesting key values where plotted for analysis purposes. The particular analysis that this repo was made for was to investigate whether high share price increase for stocks between closing and opening the next day, could be linked to any sentiments in news related to the stock, that happend between the closing and opening hours. The next step would then have been to scrap the web for news and use some machine learning library for identifying sentiments in the news texts, using natrual language processing (NLP). The hypothesis was that for small cap biotech companies, the stock price could be heavily linked to positive news, which could be exploited for knowing when to buy stocks, and then sell them after a few hours.

Sadly, I lost interest after making the stock analysis part, and haven't implemented any news scrapping or NLP. However, this repo can serve as an example on how to automate scrapping, processing, and analysing stock prices.
